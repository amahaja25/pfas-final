<h1>Final Data Visualization Project</h1>
<p>This repository contains all of the code and static images used in my final project for JOUR328T with Professor Adam Marton at the University of Maryland, College Park. I used data from the Environmental Protection Agency and PFAS Project Lab to visualize the prevalence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the U.S.</p>
<p>I used D3.js, Adobe Illustrator and FLourish to create static and interactive graphics for this project.</p>
